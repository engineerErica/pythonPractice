Join me on my Python journey!
Python is a coding language that I have wanted to learn since being exposed to it. I was selected from a competitive pool of alumni to be a member of the Career Launch Accelerator (CLA) Program after graduating from the Marcy Lab School in March of 2024. Part of the CLA Program involved direct Python instruction from a senior software engineer at Meta over 10 weeks. Through this course, I have gained solid foundational skills required to complete LeetCodes and other forms of technical interview prep, such as control flow, loops, data structures, functions, and classes. Equipped with these valuable tools, I am ready to dive deeper into my coding journey as I prepare for my first full-time role.
